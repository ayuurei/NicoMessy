---> Nico's Messy Miscellany <--- 

One may consider this mod as just... a bundle of random crap. 
You could say... a bunch of "Miscellaneous" stuff :3

This entire mod was made with the sole purpose of being something i can mess around with in my solo worlds, or with my friends.
You're free to download this... if you're okay with items that may be absolutely asinine, or ones that will literally make the game a living nightmare (for both you the enemies, of course)

Please Note: Since i'm a bit of a crazy person, there could be no updates in weeks (maybe months); but then there could be an update happening every day for a bit.


At the moment, there is very little content included. However i'm currently in a very big Terraria brainrot so there will be frequent updates!
