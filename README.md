<h3>On the topic of the code</h3>
Feel free to borrow / use the code here as reference, just know that **i myself** have also referenced some of the code, included in the **__codecredits.txt__**
My only requirement is that you credit not only me, but also the work of the people included in codecredits (if you reference the bit of code i had referenced from theirs.)
